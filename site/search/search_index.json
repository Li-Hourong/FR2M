Then L will certainly met with the curve at a third point S. Suppose the symmetric point of S about the x axis is R, then we define R = P + Q and R = -S. If L has only 2 intersections P and S with the curve, meaning that P, Q merge at one point and P is actually a point of contact. In this case we define R = -S = 2P. Meanwhile we define the point infinite far away as 0 and the symmetric point of P about x axis as -P. For any point P on an elliptic curve,  if kP = 0, define the minimum k as the order of P. If k doesn't exist, define k as infinite.

To encipher a piece of message, the sender first selects a random number n(smaller than the order of G) and calculates 2 points P = nG and Q = M + nS(M is the message to encipher). Then (P, Q) will be passed. To decipher the message, the receiver just need to use its own private key to calculate Q - dP = M + nS - dP = M + ndG - dnG = M If anyone want to hack using P and Q, figuring out d would be the biggest chanllenge since its so difficult to get d from S and G.  </p> <p>I guess it is quite clear how asymmetric encrypto algorithms work. To creat a kind of asymmetric encrypto algorithm, the key step is to find an operation that is easy to perform but with a difficult inverse operation. In RSA, multiplying 2 prime number is easy, but break they from a large number is difficult. In ECC, given k and G, it would be easy to calculate kG, but it is much more difficult to get k from S and G.</p>"}]}
