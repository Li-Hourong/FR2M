Then we need to consider if we can recover the change. The same thing happens when information is stored somewhere like a disk, and after a period of time the information may get lost. So the problem is about three things: whether the information is changed, where the changes happened and how can we recover it.  </p>"},{"location":"Parity%26Encrypto/#parity","title":"Parity","text":"<p>Odd-even Parity is the simpliest way of parity. Suppose you have a sequence of 1 and 0 to pass from the sender to the receiver. Then the sender can make a convention with the receiver: first, append one additional bit at the end of the sequence. And whether the last bit is 1/0 is dicided by the number of 1 in the sequence so that the number of 1 in the whole sequence should be even. And if the receiver found that there are odd number of 1 in the sequence, it should be affirm that something must be wrong in the trans mission.  </p> <p>However only one additional bit can only tell the receiver whether the information is damaged, but not where the damage happens. So two-dimensional parity took place, and it can correct single-bit error in a sequence.  </p> <p>This kind of ability to detect and correct errors is called Forward Error Correction(FEC). </p>"},{"location":"Parity%26Encrypto/#two-dimensional-parity","title":"Two-dimensional Parity","text":"<p>Suppose a single bit was changed in a sequence of d digits 1/0 sequence during transmission. To detect the position of the error, we may make a table like this:(suppose d = 15) 1 0 1 0 1 \u2003 1 1 0 1 1 0 \u2003 0 0 1 1 1 0 \u2003 1  </p> <p>0 0 1 0 1 \u2003 0 We can fold the whole sequence into a 3*5 table, and for each row and column the sender set one parity bit, so that the number of 1 in every row and column should be even.
